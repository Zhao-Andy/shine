# Shine Dashboard App

An AngularJS and Ruby on Rails dashboard app based on David Bryant Copeland's book, [*Rails, Angular, Postgresql, and Bootstrap: Second Edition*](https://pragprog.com/book/dcbang2/rails-angular-postgres-and-bootstrap-second-edition).

This app is strictly for learning purposes, and I highly advise that you buy Copeland's book as mentioned above if you want to follow this example app.

Unlike my other app [helperhood](https://github.com/Zhao-Andy/helperhood) which has Angular and Bootstrap served via Rails' asset pipeline, Shine has Angular and Bootstrap served up via Webpack and managed using NPM.
